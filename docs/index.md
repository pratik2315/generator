AsyncAPI Generator is a fast, feature-rich and ready to use Javascript based library. We can use the generator to generate whatever we want based on the AsyncAPI specification file. Among other things, it can be used for generating code, documentation, diagrams, markdown files, microservices and applications. AsyncAPI offers a library of Templates which can be used to start generating code and docs immediately. 

>ðŸ’¡ Note: Quickly start using generator library by following our [installation and usage]() guide. 

AsyncAPI specification file and Template are the two building blocks of the Generator library. AsyncAPI specification file is a YAML file which describes the interface of your application as well as documents how event driven APIs interact with your application in a machine readable format. AsncAPI file is the primary input file fed to the generator library. This file decides what content you want to generate from the generator library. 

Generator knows what to generate because you supplement it with a Template. A template is a project where you provide all the files that must be generated using available generator features.
