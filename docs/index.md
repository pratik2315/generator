AsyncAPI Generator is a fast, feature-packed and ready to use Javascript based library. We can use the generator to generate whatever we want based on the AsyncAPI specification file. Among other things, it can be used for generating code, documentation, diagrams, markdown files, microservices and applications. AsyncAPI offers a library of Templates which can be used to start generating code and docs immediately. 

>ðŸ’¡ Note: Quickly start using generator library by following our [installation and usage]() guide. 

Generator helps organizations and developers speed up their project by automating the code or documentation generation process. Generator simplifies the generation process by providing us with a set of tools which help us produce our desired output in just a few steps! Generator promotes reusability. Once you have the AsyncAPI input file ready, you get access to multiple Templates. With minimum modification, you can generate code and documentation for different frameworks and languages.

- Quick set up and easy to use on a regular basis
- Effortless generation of complex documents
- List of readily available AsyncAPI templates
- Support for render engines such as React and Nunjucks

AsyncAPI specification file and Template are the two building blocks of the Generator library. AsyncAPI specification file is a YAML file which describes the interface of your application as well as documents how event driven APIs interact with your application in a machine readable format. AsncAPI file is the primary input file fed to the generator library. This file decides what content you want to generate from the generator library. 

Generator knows what to generate because you supplement it with a Template. A template is a project where you provide all the files that must be generated using available generator features.
